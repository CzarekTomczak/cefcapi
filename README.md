cefcapi
=======
NOT YET READY.

A simple example on how to use the C API in Chromium Embedded
Framework.

Currently tested only on Linux. Works fine with CEF 3 branch 1750
revision 1604.

TODO: create python script that will generate callbacks for all
handlers and a corresponding initialize_structname() functions
for each handler.


Getting started
---------------
1. Copy binaries to the Release/ directory.
2. Run "make" command.
